;; Each mapping is called a region, and will contain multiple blocks.
;; Blocks are expected to evenly divide into a region, though slack
;; space at the end of a region is permissible. The slack space will
;; be (mod region-size block-size).
;; - nr-blocks is the total number of blocks in a file
;; - block-size is the number of bytes in a block
;; - nr-mapped-regions is a cached value for the count of mapped-byte-buffers.
;; - mapped-byte-buffers is a seq of all regions.
;; - stride is the size of a region
;; - file is the File being mapped
;; - raf is the RandomAccessFile for the file
;; - fc is the FileChannel of the raf

   no longer accessible. Therefore, the resources must be released implicitly (by setting
   all references null) and then calling this code to prompt the system to clean the
   resources up. Depending on the host OS, this method may need to be called several times.
