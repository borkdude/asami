## [1.2.1] - 2020-08-21
### Fixed
- Fixed problem that duplicated optional constraints during query planning.
- Fixed zero steps for transitive paths between nodes.

## [1.2.0] - 2020-08-19
### Added
- User planning can now be selected with query options. Add `:planner :user` to the end of the query arguments.
- `optional` operator, as per the [SPARQL OPTIONAL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#optionals) operation.
- Added `show-plan` function to observe how a query will be performed.

### Changed
- Selecting variables as transitive attributes returns a path vector for that column.

### Fixed
- Fixed issue with filter arguments sometimes failing.
- Transitive querying. Now handles unbound path elements better, planning is improved, and zero-steps are properly handled.
- Tuple selector in the `:find` clause now work for single elements, and with empty results.
- Single graph element in the `:in` clause now works.


## 1.1.0 - 2020-08-05
### Added
- Attributes can be modified on entities by using the `'` annotation (see [Replacement Annotation doc](https://github.com/threatgrid/asami/wiki/Transactions#replacement-annotations) for details)
- Arrays in entities can be appended to by using the `+` annotation on attributes (see [Append Annotation doc](https://github.com/threatgrid/asami/wiki/Transactions#append-annotation) for details)
- Queries now accept `_` symbols as wildcards, and accept shortened constraints (not just triples)
- Introduce new `:find` clause syntaxes (see [Find Clause Description doc](https://github.com/threatgrid/asami/wiki/Querying#find-clause-description) for details)
- Created documentation for the API, data structures, querying, and creating transactions.

### Changed
- Entities now represent multi-arity attributes as a set of values. If more than one of an attribute is found, then a set of those values is returned in the entity. Similarly, providing a set will result in using the attribute multiple times in the graph.

### Fixed
- Entity arrays are now returned as vectors and not lists.


## 1.0.0 - 2020-07-29
### Added
- New Datomic-style API
- Implemented Datom object for transaction reporting
- Entity API provided via Zuko
