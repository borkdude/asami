  "Updates a database. This is currently synchronous, but returns a future or delay for compatibility with Datomic.
   connection: The connection to the database to be updated.
   tx-info: This is either a seq of items to be transacted, or a map.
            If this is a map, then a :tx-data value will contain the same type of seq that tx-info may have.
            Each item to be transacted is one of:
            - vector of the form: [:db/add entity attribute value] - creates a datom
            - vector of the form: [:db/retract entity attribute value] - removes a datom
            - map: an entity to be inserted/updated.
            Alternatively, a map may have a :tx-triples key. If so, then this is a seq of 3 element vectors.
            Each vector in a :tx-triples seq will contain the raw values for [entity attribute value]
  Entities and assertions may have attributes that are keywords with a trailing ' character.
  When these appear an existing attribute without that character will be replaced. This only occurs for the top level
  entity, and is not applied to attributes appearing in nested structures.
  Entities can be assigned a :db/id value. If this is a negative number, then it is considered a temporary value and
  will be mapped to a system-allocated ID. Other entities can reference such an entity using that ID.
  Entities can be provided a :db/ident value of any type. This will be considered unique, and can be used to identify
  entities for updates in subsequent transactions.

  Returns a future/delay object that will hold a map containing the following:
  :db-before    database value before the transaction
  :db-after     database value after the transaction
